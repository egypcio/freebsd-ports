Snowflake is a new WebRTC pluggable transport inspired by Flashproxy. It is 
currently in alpha, reliably bootstrapping a Tor client to 100% and providing 
a reasonable browsing experience with Tor Browser. However, Snowflake is 
under active development. It is not yet considered stable or audited, and 
should not yet be relied upon for any critical use-cases.
