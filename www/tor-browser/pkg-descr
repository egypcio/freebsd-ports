  Tor Browser is a customized version of Firefox Extended Service Release (ESR)
built specifically for internet browsing over the Tor network. Its default 
configuration aims to mitigate attacks on a client's anonymity, including 
determining the client's actual IP address and browser fingerprinting. Other
aspects of Firefox have also been patched to plug privacy leaks in ways not 
possible any other way.
