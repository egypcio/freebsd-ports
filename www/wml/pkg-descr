WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation toolkit
for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2). It is
written in ANSI C and Perl 5, build via a GNU Autoconf based source tree
and runs out-of-the-box on all major Unix derivates.  It can be used
free of charge both in educational and commercial environments.

WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships with a
well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level features build
on top of the backends core languages.
