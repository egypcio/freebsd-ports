OONI Probe is free and open source software designed to measure internet 
censorship and other forms of network interference. This version is the next
generation of OONI Probe written in Go (a.k.a. GOONI).

All OONI Probe tests are implemented in Measurement Kit, the network measurement
engine that powers the OONI Probe apps.
