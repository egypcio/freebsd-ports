Tor Browser uses the Tor network to protect your privacy and anonymity. Using
the Tor network has two main properties:

  * Your internet service provider, and anyone watching your connection locally,
  will not be able to track your internet activity, including the names and
  addresses of the websites you visit.

  * The operators of the websites and services that you use, and anyone watching
  them, will see a connection coming from the Tor network instead of your real
  Internet (IP) address, and will not know who you are unless you explicitly
  identify yourself.

In addition, Tor Browser is designed to prevent websites from "fingerprinting"
or identifying you based on your browser configuration. By default, Tor Browser
does not keep any browsing history. Cookies are only valid for a single session
(until Tor Browser is exited or a New Identity is requested).
