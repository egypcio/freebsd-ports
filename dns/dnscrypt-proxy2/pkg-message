======================================================================
Version 2 of dnscrypt-proxy is written in Go, and therefore isn't capable
  of dropping privileges after binding to a low port on FreeBSD.

By default, this port's daemon will listen on port 5353 (TCP/UDP) as the 
  %%USER%% user. It's still possible to bind it and listen on port 53 (TCP/UDP),
  but it's not recommended.

Below are a few examples on how to redirect traffic from port 5353 to 53.

[ipfw]

  /etc/rc.firewall.local:
    ipfw nat 1 config if lo0 reset same_ports \
      redirect_port tcp 127.0.0.1:5353 53 \
      redirect_port udp 127.0.0.1:5353 53
    ipfw add nat 1 ip from any to 127.0.0.1 via lo0

  /etc/rc.conf:
    firewall_enable="YES"
    firewall_nat_enable="YES"

  /etc/sysctl.conf:
    net.inet.ip.fw.one_pass=0

[pf]

  /etc/pf.conf:
    set skip on lo0
    rdr pass on lo0 proto { tcp udp } from any to port 53 -> 127.0.0.1 port 5353

  /etc/rc.conf:
    pf_enable="YES"

[unbound]

  /etc/rc.conf:
    local_unbound_enable="YES"

  /var/unbound/unbound.conf:
    server:
      interface:              127.0.0.1
      do-not-query-localhost: no

  /var/unbound/forward.conf:
    forward-zone:
      name:         "."
      forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@5353

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using local_unbound, DNSSEC is enabled by default. You should
  comment the "auto-trust-anchor-file" line or change dnscrypt-proxy to use
  servers with DNSSEC support only.
