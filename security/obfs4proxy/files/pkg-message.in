 To use obfs4 as a Bridge Client, please add the following configuration
to your 'torrc' config file:

	ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec %%PREFIX%%/bin/obfs4proxy

  To enable this Pluggable Transport in your Tor Bridge, use the
following configurations in your 'torrc' file:

	# Use obfs4proxy to provide the obfuscator
	ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec %%PREFIX%%/bin/obfs4proxy managed

	# Enable Extended ORPort
	ExtORPort auto

	## (Optional) Listen on the specified IP:PORT for obfs4 connections
	## as opposed to picking a random port automatically
	# ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:443

  obfs4proxy is backwards compatible with obfs2 and obfs3 either in client or 
server mode. If you want to use it like this, please adjust your 'torrc' 
config file to fit your needs. It's compatible with ScrambleSuit in client mode.
